# Spearhead Mix League
## This is simple front interface of Medal of Honor Alied Assault: Spearhead - Mix League. 

The graphic interface refers to the clanbase.com website. Everyone who played multiplayer games 15 years ago knew this site very well. There is one positive aspect of the coronavirus, old friends are playing Spearhead together again. To diversify the gameplay, I created a ranking game based on the ELO ranking (I use a script written by Oliver Wang). The project is extended with new functionalities. There are plans to add comments under the matches, add win or lose streak marks, data graphs and improve code quality.

## Front:
- Vanilla JS (ES6)

- Webpack

## Backend:
- Google sheets
- https://github.com/oliverdwang/fps-elo
